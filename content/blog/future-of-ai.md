Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in how we approach software engineering. From code generation tools like GitHub Copilot to intelligent user interfaces, AI is integrated into every layer of the stack.

## The Rise of Intelligent UIs

Modern web applications are moving beyond static interactions. We are seeing:

- **Predictive UX**: Interfaces that anticipate user needs.
- **Generative Content**: Dynamic text and image generation on the fly.
- **Personalization**: adapting layouts and content based on user behavior in real-time.

## Code Generation & DevOps

Developers are becoming architects. With AI handling boilerplate code and unit tests, we can focus on:

1. System Architecture
2. Scalability
3. Security Compliance

The future is here, and it's intelligent.
